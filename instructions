the assignment goes as so. I am giving you guys this parent class/interface called employee here. 
Working together I want each of you to create a separate class: accountant, janitor, salesman, and manager. 
The ultimate goal for you guys is to create a program that will ask the user which variable do you want to print. as so:
//for salesman:
//computer script// what do you want to know?
//user input// hours
//computer script// 40
understood great. if there are any problems with the program so, work to fix it together, make a plan and have it ready for me when possible.
